# chOpen-ML-Workshop-2017

This is the repository for my workshop [Machine Learning for Software Developers](https://workshoptage.ch/workshops/machine-learning-fuer-software-entwickler/) at CH Open Workshop Days 2017.

Here you will find the environment to follow the workshop and to run the exercises and the exercises themselves along with suggested solutions. After the workshop is over, I'll upload the slides as well.
